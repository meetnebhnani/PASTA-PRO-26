Boil the pasta according to instructions on the package and drain. Note: use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies.
Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add all the veggies - onion, peppers and broccoli and cook for 2 minutes. You want veggies to remain crunchy. Remove the veggies from pan and set aside.
To the same pan, now add olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of butter. Once the butter melts, add the chopped garlic and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant.
Then add in the flour. Whisk the flour continuously, using a wire whisk for around 1 minute. You don't have to brown the flour.
Then add the in the milk and the cream. You can skip the cream and use only milk here.
Whisk to combine. Let the sauce simmer for 2 minutes.
The sauce will thicken and coat the back of the spoon.
Add oregano, Italian seasoning, red chili flakes (if using) and mix. Also add salt and black pepper to the sauce.
Let the sauce simmer on medium heat another minute or so and then add the cheese (if using) and mix until it melts. Now turn the heat to the lowest.
Stir in the boiled pasta and the sauteed veggies. Toss until the pasta and veggies are coated with the sauce. Taste test and adjust the seasonings at this point.
Serve white sauce pasta immediately out of the pan with parmesan cheese if needed. Tastes best when fresh. Enjoy!
